My experience is in Data Science and Machine Learning. I am passionate about algorithms, coding and data. I would identify myself as a curious but stochastic entity with an eagerness to stuff my mind with new permutations of `0`'s and `1`'s.

Always ready for a nice hike or a game of badminton, pool or pickle-ball. I also love playing piano, video games and consider myself an amateur origmai artist.
