The Einstein's Equation is given by

$$G_{\mu \nu} = R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2}R\ g_{\mu \nu} =  \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu \nu}$$

A parameterized curve $x^\mu(\lambda)$ is a geodesic if it obeys

$$\frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d\lambda^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\rho \sigma} \frac{dx^\rho}{d\lambda} \frac{dx^\sigma}{d\lambda} = 0,$$

known as the *geodesic* equation. The quantity $\Gamma^\mu_{\rho \sigma}$ is known as the *Christoffel symbol* and is obtained from the metric via the relation:

$$\Gamma^\mu_{\rho \sigma} = \frac{1}{2} g^{\mu \nu} (\partial_\rho g_{\sigma \nu} + \partial_\sigma g_{\nu \rho} - \partial_\nu g_{\rho \sigma}).$$
