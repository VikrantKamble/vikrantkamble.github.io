One of the most basic things that one can do with an array is to have a pointer or a set of pointers that
traverse the array in some fashion. The number of pointers to *book-keep* depends on the question at hand.
Let's look at few sample problems to understand this concept:

- Given an array *nums* compute the largest element.

To find the largest element, we have to *at-least* visit each element in the array. Thus we need 
a **single** pointer to traverse the array. We will reserve a constant memory space that holds the value
of the largest element or at least the index of the position that holds the largest element. 

```python
def get_largest(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    largest_num = float('-inf')
    for num in nums:
        largest_num = max(largest_num, num)

    return -1 if largest_num == float('-inf') else largest_num
```

- Given an array *nums* and a *target* check if target exists in the array.

Since we are not given any extra information as to the structure of the array, e.g. sorted or not, 
we should write a solution for the generic case. Similar to the previous case, we *need* a pointer that 
scans through the array and at each step check for equality of the element with the target. This gives 
us $O(n)$ time complexity and $O(1)$ space complexity algorithm as follows:

```python
def find_target(nums: List[int], target: int) -> bool:
    for num in nums:
        if num == target:
            return True
    return False
```

Here is a slightly complicated problem, where we have a single traversal pointer: **given a linked list, reverse it.**

```python
def rev_linked_list(head):
    new_head = None
    while head is not None:
        next_in_line = head.next
        head.next, new_head = new_head, head
        head = next_in_line
    return new_head
```

- Given a **sorted** array *nums* and a *target* check if there exists $(i, j)$ such that $nums[i] + nums[j] = target$ and $i \ne j$.

Since we need to find two elements from the array that sum to the target, we should probably use two pointers. But the questions is where 
should they be placed *initially*. Ideally we would like to, on each iteration, *update* one or both the pointers and the updates should be such 
that we *march* towards the *breaking* or *end-of-iteration* criteria. In this case, we should place one pointer at the beginning and the 
other at the end. We will call them *left* and *right* respectively. If the sum of the elements at these positions is *greater* than the target, 
then the only way to bring down the sum is to decrease the *right* pointer. Conversly, if the sum is *smaller* than the target, the only 
way to increase the sum is to update the *left* pointer. Note that the we can make the above two statements only in this specific case of 
sorted array. If they sum to the target, we have found the pair and simply exit the iteration. 

```python
def two_sum_sorted(nums: List[int], target: int) -> bool:
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        curr_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if curr_sum == target:
            return True
        elif curr_sum > target:
            right -= 1
        else:
            left += 1
    return False
```


- You are given an integer array *nums* of length n; such that each element represent a height of a column placed at that index, with the base resting on the $x-axis$. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water and return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Since we need to create a *container*, we need two columns and hence two pointers, the left and the right column of the container places at indices $i$ and $j$, such that $i < j$. Now the question is what should be the *initial* placement of these pointers.

We actually only have 2 sensible choices:
- One after other $i=0, j=1$
- Opposite ends $i=0, j=len(nums) - 1$.

At any given configuration $(i, j)$, the volume of the water contained is: $V = width \times height = (j - i) * min(nums[i], nums[j])$. 

If we place the pointers at opposite ends, then in every iteration we will either increment $i$ or decrement $j$, i.e. the *width* will **always** decrease. Hence the only hope of finding the container with more water is to increase the height. Since the height of the water volume is controlled by the smaller of the two columns, the pointer of the column which is smallest should be updated.

If instead we had chosen the `one-after-other` configuration, then in each iteration, the *width* will either decrease or increase and we won't be able to make a decision as to which pointer to update as we did above.

```python
def most_water_container(heights: List[int]) -> int:
    max_water_content = float('-inf')

    left, right = 0, len(heights) - 1
    while left < right:
        # Water content = width * (bar with the lower height of the two)
        water_content = (right - left) * min(heights[left], heights[right])
        max_water_content = max(max_water_content, water_content)

        # Which pointer to update? We will be making the width smaller with
        # the next pointer update, so the only hope for increasing the water content
        # is to increse the minimum height. Hence we should update the pointer
        # of the bar with the lower height of the two.
        if heights[left] < heights[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1

    return max_water_content
```

Kadane's Algorithm
===========

Let's say we are given an array of integers; the goal is to find a subarray with the maximum sum.

To do this we find the subarray that starts at any given index, but ends on the index being considered; and we do this
for every index. Let's say that we have a such a subarray that ends on index $i-1$; shown in green. Now what would be the max subarray that ends 
on index $i$. Well we have two options: either we extend the previous subarray (blue) or we go solo i.e. start anew (red). Once we have the 
max subarrays ending at each index, the result will be the one that has the maximum value.

![](/images/posts/kadane.png)

```python
def max_sum_subarray(nums):
    curr_sum, max_sum = nums[0], nums[0]
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        curr_sum = max(curr_sum + nums[i], nums[i])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)
    return max_sum
```

The above algorithm will give the max subarray sum. However, if we also wanted the subarray `[left index, right index]` that had that sum, we have to modify the algorithm a little bit.
Basically we keep track of the *ending index* of the max subarray. Then we traverse the array in the backward direction starting at the ending index, 
until we find the element that *started* the subarray.

```python
def max_sum_subarray(nums):
    ending_idx = 0
    curr_sum, max_sum = nums[0], nums[0]
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        curr_sum = max(curr_sum + nums[i], nums[i])

        if curr_sum > max_sum:
            ending_idx = i
            max_sum = curr_sum

    # traverse back to find the start index
    last_sum, start_idx = max_sum, ending_idx
    while last_sum != nums[start_idx]:
        last_sum -= nums[start_idx]
        start_idx -= 1
    return start_idx, ending_idx, max_sum
```
