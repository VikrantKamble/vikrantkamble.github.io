Let's say we have the following table `Users`, where *user_id* is the column with unique values for this table. 
The goal is to find for each user, the minimum of the two values for *col_a* and *col_b*.
```
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| user_id     | int      |
| col_a       | int      |
| col_b       | int      |
+-------------+----------+
```
To do this, we can use the `LEAST` function (and its counterpart `GREATEST`):
```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  LEAST(col_a, col_b) AS min_val
FROM Users
```

- What if we want to **cap** a column to some minimum value `cap_val`?

```sql
SELECT
    user_id,
    GREATEST(10, col_a) AS cap_val
FROM Users
```

Window functions
------------

Let's say we have a table called `Purchases`, where each row contains a user with *user_id* purchasing product *product_name* on *buy_date* of *quantity*.

```

| user_id | product_name | buy_date | quantity |
| ------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- |
| 1       | A            | 5        | 10       |
| 1       | B            | 6        | 12       |
| 2       | C            | 2        | 21       |
| 2       | D            | 2        | 42       |
| 2       | F            | 1        | 16       |
| 2       | E            | 6        | 18       |
| 3       | E            |          |          |

```

**NOTE** that the frame used for calculating window function results for a given row depends on the presence of **ORDER BY** as stated [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/window-functions-frames.html). 
To state here:
- If `ORDER BY` present: `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`
- If `ORDER BY` not present: `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`

**Also**, these window functions don't use `frame` but instead the entire `partition`: *DENSE_RANK(), LAG(), LEAD(), RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()*.

Here are some common window functions applied with `OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY buy_date DESC)`, as per the query (**notice** especially the behavior of *LAST_VALUE* and *SUM*):
```sql
SELECT 
	*,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY buy_date) AS row_num, 
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY buy_date) AS `rank`, 
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY buy_date) AS `dense_rank`,
    FIRST_VALUE(product_name) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY buy_date) AS `first_product`,
    LAST_VALUE(product_name) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY buy_date) AS `last_product`,
    LEAD(product_name) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY buy_date) AS `lead_product`,
    LAG(product_name) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY buy_date) AS `lag_product`,
    SUM(quantity) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY buy_date) AS `total_quantity`
FROM Purchases;
```

The output is:

```

| user_id | product_name | buy_date | quantity | row_num | rank | dense_rank |
| ------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- | ------- | ---- | ---------- |
| 1       | A            | 5        | 10       | 1       | 1    | 1          |
| 1       | B            | 6        | 12       | 2       | 2    | 2          |
| 2       | F            | 1        | 16       | 1       | 1    | 1          |
| 2       | C            | 2        | 21       | 2       | 2    | 2          |
| 2       | D            | 2        | 42       | 3       | 2    | 2          |
| 2       | E            | 6        | 18       | 4       | 4    | 3          |
| 3       | E            |          |          | 1       | 1    | 1          |


```

```
| user_id | product_name | buy_date | quantity | first_product | last_product | lead_product | lag_product | total_quantity |
| ------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------- | -------------- |

| 2       | D            | 2        | 42       | F             | D            | E            | C           | 79             |

| 3       | E            |          |          | E             | E            |              |             |                |

Window function with GROUP BY
---------------

Let's say we have a table called `Orders`; where each row (unique *order_id*) is an order for a certain product along with the quantity of that product bought. 
```
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| order_id    | int      |
| product_id  | int      |
| quantity    | int      |
+-------------+----------+
```

- We would like to rank the products based on their total quantity purchased. 

To do this one would first do an *aggregation* to count the number of items of each product bought and then *rank* them using a window function as follows:

```sql
SELECT
  product_id,
  RANK() OVER(ORDER BY total_quantity DESC) AS `rank`
FROM (
  SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
  FROM Orders
  GROUP BY 1
) AS k
```

However, the *window* and the *group by* can be combined as follows:
```sql
SELECT product_id,
       RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(quantity)) AS `rank`
FROM Orders
GROUP BY 1
```

The reason being that window function are evaluated in the *SELECT* clause; which executes **after** the *GROUP BY* clause.
